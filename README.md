# MURAT
MURAT (Multiagent URbAn Traffic control) is a multi-agent system to control traffic in an urban area. This distributed system use several agents to manage traffic through traffic lights.

A fundamental part of the MURAT system is to provide a high degree of reliability based mainly on correct communication and coordination between the different agents that make up the system. This avoids problems of collisions between vehicles due to traffic lights that are wrongly set to green at intersections. In addition, it allows optimisation of traffic light timing to process a greater flow of traffic in different scenarios.

In order to build the MURAT system correctly, it has to be taken into account which types of agents constitute it and how they are structured from a social point of view. The organisation of the agents forms the basis of the modelling.

To test the proper functioning of MURAT system, several traffic simulations have been carried out. In these simulations, routes with heavy traffic congestion are being reproduced during different periods of time, aiming to represent reality as faithfully as possible.
